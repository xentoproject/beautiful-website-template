Some great places to find guidances when you get lost would be [w3schools](https://w3schools.com) and [This life changing video!](https://youtu.be/pQN-pnXPaVg)

An effort has been made to comment this code efficiently to enable users of this app to understand the app from a glance and to be able to change the content with minimal knowledge!

## Changing the content...

To change images simply right click the directory and upload the correct files, you will then need to change the paths within the websites code, there are simple comments to guide you to where to do this!

When looking to change the text simply find the text you wish to edit within the code and adapt it to what you would like to replace it with, you may also search through the code comments between `<!-- -->` for the code you need, the majority of things within the site are commented with what they are and what they do to help you code!

## Changing the looks...

If you wish to update the style of the site check the `style.css` file and edit away, all the classes will match the elements of the main site in the `index.html` file, making it easy for you to locate everything you need!

## Adding scripts...

Autocode supports the use of front end programming in JavaScript, you can add additional script functions in the already linked `script.js` file!
